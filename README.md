# Model-based Testing & Microservices

This repository contains the source code used for the Bachelor Thesis **"Model-based Testing & Microservices"** by Paul Ganzevoort. It is an adaptation of Bas van den Brink's tool found at https://github.com/basvdbrink/model-based-testing-tool for the specific purpose of testing the DYNAMOS project (https://github.com/Jorrit05/DYNAMOS).

Most of the adaptations are clunky, ad-hoc and purpose-built for my local DYNAMOS setup. This codebase is what I ran my thesis experiments with, but is not recommended for any other use.
